title: what's in Jaimie's file?
---

```{r}
library(oce)
file <- "~/data/AZMP/winter/1997/CTD_NED1996254_003_01_DN.ODF.nc"
# Method 1
d <- read.netcdf(file)
print(names(d@data))
# Um, not too sure what all this stuff is... let's just read it with
# low-level things to be sure we don't get mixed up by assumptions made
# by oce.

# Method 2
library(ncdf4)
nc <- nc_open(file)
names(nc$var)
# guessing... but notice that pressure is well, I dunno
pressure <- ncvar_get(nc, "PRESPR01")
str(pressure)
temperature <- ncvar_get(nc, "TEMPS601")
str(temperature)
#time <- numberAsPOSIXct(time)
salinity <- ncvar_get(nc, "PSALST01")
str(salinity)
ctd <- as.ctd(salinity = salinity, temperature = temperature, pressure = pressure)
# I normally plot with eos="gsw" but for that we need to know longitude and latitude,
# which *may* be in the file, but the first thing is to figure out which things
# to read!
plot(ctd, eos = "unesco")

# Get whole info next but it's a LOT!
nc
```
